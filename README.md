# Notebooks
Home to jupyter notebooks for Mindee OSS projects

To open and interact with them locally, you can install the [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) available for Linux, macOS, and Windows (free and Open Source).

## Adding/modifying notebooks

Should you wish to add a jupyter notebook here, please update the corresponding documentation references to those notebooks in each project.

For instance, if you modify a notebook in `doctr/`, you might consider editing its [README](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/notebooks/README.md).
