# Notebooks
Home to jupyter notebooks for Mindee OSS projects


## Using notebooks

This repository was made to store Jupyter notebooks, but users are expected to access them through the corresponding projects. For instance, in docTR, you can find a reference to the dedicated notebooks [here](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/tree/main/notebooks), which is automatically deployed in the documentation over [there](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest/notebooks.html).

This will provide you with better options to interact with those, such as [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).


## Adding/modifying notebooks

Should you wish to add a jupyter notebook here, please update the corresponding documentation references to those notebooks in each project.

For instance, if you modify a notebook in `doctr/`, you might consider editing its [README](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/blob/main/notebooks/README.md).
